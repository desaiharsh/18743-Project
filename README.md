Topic: Power and Performance Analysis of emerging NVM technologies (STT-MRAM/SOT-MRAM) compare to conventional memory technologies (SRAM)

Description: Our goal is to develop a PPA comparison of emerging contenders for SRAM as the leading cache memory technology. We compare STT and SOT MRAM against SRAM on the basis of area, power and latency.
